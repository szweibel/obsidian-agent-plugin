## Prerequisites

### Required

1. **Obsidian Desktop** - This plugin only works on desktop (not mobile)
2. **Claude Code CLI** - Install the Claude Code command-line tool
   - Install: `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`
   - Or download from [Claude Code releases](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code)
3. **Anthropic API Key** - Configure Claude Code with your API key
   - Get key: [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com/)
   - Configure: Run `claude config` in your terminal

### Verification

Test that Claude Code is working:
```bash
claude --version
```

## Installation

### Manual Installation

1. Download the latest release from the [Releases page](../../releases)
2. Extract the files to your vault's plugins folder:
   ```
   <vault>/.obsidian/plugins/obsidian-agent/
   ```
3. The folder should contain:
   - `main.js`
   - `manifest.json`
   - `styles.css` (if present)
4. Reload Obsidian
5. Enable "Obsidian Agent" in Settings ‚Üí Community Plugins

### BRAT Installation (for beta testing)

1. Install the [BRAT plugin](https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian42-brat)
2. Add this repository: `szweibel/obsidian-agent-plugin`
3. BRAT will auto-update the plugin when new versions are released

## Configuration

### First Time Setup

1. Open **Settings ‚Üí Obsidian Agent**
2. Click **"Auto-Detect"** to find your Claude Code CLI path
   - If auto-detect fails, manually enter the path (e.g., `C:\Users\YourName\.local\bin\claude.exe` on Windows)
3. (Optional) Customize the **Workflow Preferences** to match your vault

### Workflow Customization

The workflow preferences control how the agent organizes your vault. You can customize:

- **Folder Structure** - Update folder names to match your vault (e.g., change `Library/` to `Work/`)
- **Inbox System** - Configure for daily notes, scratchpad, inbox file, or your own system
- **Processing Workflow** - Modify how the agent processes and organizes content
- **Linking Philosophy** - Adjust how aggressively the agent creates links

**Examples:**
- Daily notes workflow: Change `Scratchpad.md` to `Daily/YYYY-MM-DD.md` throughout the workflow
- Custom inbox: Use `Inbox.md`, `Capture.md`, or whatever you prefer
- Different folder names: Replace `Library/` with your own folder structure

**Note:** The default workflow uses Scratchpad.md as an inbox, but you can easily customize it. Core rules and tool descriptions are protected - only workflow preferences are customizable.

### "Claude Code executable not found"

**Solution:**
1. Verify Claude Code is installed: `claude --version`
2. Go to Settings ‚Üí Obsidian Agent
3. Click "Auto-Detect" or manually enter the CLI path
4. Common paths:
   - **Mac/Linux**: `~/.local/bin/claude` or `/usr/local/bin/claude`
   - **Windows**: `C:\Users\YourName\.local\bin\claude.exe`

### "Permission denied" or API errors

**Solution:**
1. Verify your API key is configured: `claude config`
2. Check your API key at [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com/)
3. Ensure you have API credits available

### Agent isn't using tools or following instructions

**Solution:**
1. Check the browser console (Ctrl+Shift+I / Cmd+Option+I)
2. Look for `[ObsidianAgent]` log messages
3. Try clearing the chat and starting a new session
4. Verify the workflow preferences in settings haven't been corrupted

### Agent suggestions don't match my vault structure

**Solution:**
1. Open Settings ‚Üí Obsidian Agent
2. Edit the Workflow Preferences to match your folder names and workflow
3. Update references like `Library/`, `Scratchpad.md`, etc. to match your vault

## Privacy & Security

- **Local Processing** - All vault operations happen locally on your machine
- **API Calls** - The plugin sends your queries and vault content to Anthropic's API via Claude Code
- **No Telemetry** - This plugin doesn't collect any usage data
- **Permissions** - The agent runs with `bypassPermissions` mode for seamless file operations

**Important**: Be mindful that vault content is sent to Anthropic's API. Don't use this plugin with sensitive/confidential information unless you're comfortable with that.
